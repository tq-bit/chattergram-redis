# Chattergram + Redis

A chat application that transcribes voice messages to text

[Insert app screenshots](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#uploading-assets)


## How it works

### How the data is stored:

- This app uses two primary data types: `Users` and `Chat` entities created by [`redis-om`](https://redis.com/blog/introducing-redis-om-client-libraries/)
- It also uses a secondary `Security` entity used to handle registering and login (MongoDB only).

#### 1. The `Users` - entity

- When a user registers, it's stored in MongoDB.
- Mongoose uses one entity for `Users`, one for `Security`.
- Fist, a `Security` entity is created. It includes the login data (User+PW-hash)
- This entity is replicated into Redis' `Users` entity.
- It includes three relevant properties
  - A unique ID - (converted from MongoDB's ObjectId, `string`)
  - The username - `(string)`
  - The online status - `(bool)`
- The replication happens from MongoDB into Redis when
  - A new user is created (partial)
  - The app is (re)-started (completely)
- In Redis, the online status is updated and propagated via. [Redis Event Queue](https://redis.com/redis-best-practices/communication-patterns/event-queue/) & propagated to connected [Websockets](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws) whenever
  - An authenticated user connects their client's websocket to port 9090 (= Set to online=true)
  - A user sends a message to another user
  - The user's Websocket client disconnects

#### 2. The `Chat` - entity

- When a chat message is created, it's stored in Redis
-


### How the data is accessed:

### Performance Benchmarks

[If you migrated an existing app to use Redis, please put performance benchmarks here to show the performance improvements.]

## How to run it locally?

[Make sure you test this with a fresh clone of your repo, these instructions will be used to judge your app.]

### Prerequisites

[Fill out with any prerequisites (e.g. Node, Docker, etc.). Specify minimum versions]

### Local installation
